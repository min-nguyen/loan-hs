In Haskell.

Requires Cabal and GHC version > 9. (I'm using GHC-9.4.8)

From this directory, you should build and run from the project directly using `cabal`:
```sh
cabal build
cabal run
```

You may also be able to run straight from the executable:
```
./Oneiro
```

// check list


// what i would do to make sure its production ready
